# simon-game

• A web-based version of the classic Simon memory game

• Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

How it works:

• The game shows a pattern of colors, and you have to memorize the pattern.

• You have to press the colors in that specific pattern.

• Each color has its own sound.

• After each round, the pattern gets one color longer.

• If you press the wrong color, the game says “Game Over”.

• The game looks colorful and plays sounds to make it more fun.
